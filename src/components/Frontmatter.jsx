            <p>More than 7,000 languages are used in the world today, contributing to making planet Earth a beautifully diverse place. In this project, we visualize the 100 most spoken languages. Each language belongs to a language family, like the Indo-European or the Sino-Tibetan families. These families can be subdivided into smaller groups called branches, like Germanic, Romance, Sinitic, and Indo-Aryan.</p>
            <p>In these visualizations, languages that do not belong to a particular branch are called Language Isolates.</p>
